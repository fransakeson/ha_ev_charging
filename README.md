## HomeAssistant, Easee, ID.4 Smart Charging + Load Balance ##

TODO:
* If car_ready_at is tomorrow AND tomorrow_valid=false, only use today - CHECK IF DONE?
* Implement deadband when amp is close to max to avoid ping pong up and down
* Comments/documentation
* Possibly making code more general and less specific to my setup
* Implement manual mode - off (already in place-smartcharge switch?) - and without id4 integration (manual SoC and target SoC sliders)
